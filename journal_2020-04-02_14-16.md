-third discussion question was due: XML vs HTML versions of "Faith is a fine intervention" by Emily Dickinson

" I didn't expect much, but in reading the two versions of the poem, its obvious that each version has a different meaning, if only slightly. The XML version deals with "faith" as a sort of absurd concept - it's been put in quotation marks, making it seem as if Faith itself is the name of some force or power, rather than the intangible concept of faith, or feeling of being faithful. Its saying that "faith" is all well and good for those who can see - those who are able-bodied and functioning. But the next two lines go on to state that "microscopes are prudent in an emergency" - meaning in a time of crisis, having just faith but no real action or solution is useless, and one must look closer to understand the problem. The HTML version is almost entirely similar, except in two areas. The second line, however, has changed the word "when" to "for", and the word faith no longer has quotations around it. I interpret this as no longer being the weird celestial force/power, but rather the intangible concept it always has been"

This was my response to the question, but when I submitted it I got the chance to look at some of my peers perpectives, and I found something interesting. Faith being in quotation marks in the XML stood out to me, but I was unable to really articulate in a satisfying way what I meant/thought about it. One of my peers said that maybe the quotes refers to the narrators skepticism of faith and its credibility, which is honestly put so much better than how I tried to say it.
