## Things I Learned Today

### Markdown

Wow! This is my *very first* markdown file!

I'm impressed with myself for **these reasons**:
- I have never even touched something that has to do with code before! This is cool!
- Not actually sure if I'm supposed to be writing something here but he said to make a list, so uhhh

- I've learned something new
- I'm on my to becoming a [digital humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities)
