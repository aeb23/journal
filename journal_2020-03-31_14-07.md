Fluid Texts: 
- "A "fluid text" refers to any literary work that exists in multiple versions, for example author's drafts, publishers' proofs, revised editions of books, adaptations for film, and expurgations for children."

(in english, that means content that exists in multiple forms of media)

For my example of fluid text, I chose Harry Potter, which if I'm being totally honest isn't the best choice, just because it doesn't have all that much literary merit (or so several of my past english teachers have told me)

But I still think it counts as fluid text, especially because there are so many forms of it - multiple plays/musicals, fanfiction, published spin offs by both the author and fans, movies, books, etc
