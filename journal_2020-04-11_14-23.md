To be entirely honest, making the timeline/the process of it was not the greatest - it wasn't hard, just boring and a bit tedious. I was often frustrated becuase one of my images' links wouldn't show up blue as a link normally does, and I still can't tell if it worked or not. 

But, once I was able to see the final result of my timeline and the images/text I put in it, I enjoyed it more.
